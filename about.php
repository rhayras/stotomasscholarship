               <p>Sto Tomas, one of the oldest town in Batangas, is located at the foot of the legendary and picturesque Mt. Makiling. It is sixty (60) kilometers south of Manila and known as the birthplace of Gen Miguel Malvar, the last Filipino General to surrender to American.</p>
               <p>The town of Sto. Tomas was actually founded in 1666, with Captain Manuel Melo as its first head. Originally, it was composed of a large Poblacion. When the Spanis friars arrived their first and foremost objective was to construct a church near the river to satisfy thier propensity for water. Thus the present site  of Roman Catholic Church was chosen.</p>
